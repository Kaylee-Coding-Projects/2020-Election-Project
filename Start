<h1>Stances</h1>
<p>Booker has three major issues he has expressed on his website. First, Criminal Justice Reform. Second,  Economics. Third, Equal Rights.</p>

<h2>Criminal Justice </h2>
<p>Booker helped draft the First Step Act. This was an act dedicated to reducing recidivism. There was an implementation of systems designed to reduce recidivism. It also redid sentencing guidelines. There was also a prohibition on using restraints on pregnant prisoners, and provisions on storing firearms. Supported Marijuana Justice Act. This is an act to legalize marijuana federally and reduce sentences for those already convicted. It was also partly an attempt to reduce the disparities of those sentenced with different racial backgrounds when charged with drug possession especially marijuana.

<h2>Economics</h2> <p>
Booker has also advocated tax reform. His plan would increase the number of benefits that most people would receive (in effect raising the poverty line higher, and all those that can benefit from income dependent benefits.) A unique idea introduced is that of creat a “baby bond.” This would mean that a set amount of money is given to everyone when they are born, and increases as the child ages. Tax reform is also looked towards as an attempt to reduce disparities between rich and poor, and different racial groups.

<h2>Equal Rights</h2> <p>
Booker has come out in support of LGBTQ+ rights. He sponsored the Equality Act. A bill that would have amended the Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected groups. His website also says he supports Medicare for All, which is usually a single payer program for medical insurance or reduced payment (usually through subsidies) for medical insurance for all or most people. The exact form that this would take under Booker’s plan is still unknown. Finally, Booker advocates for more legal environmental protections due to the impacts on vulnerable communities.</p>

 <h1>Qualifications/Disadvantages</h1>
 <p>Booker has a good grasp on laws, and what it takes to pass them. Because of his position as a Senator, he likely holds some sway over the Senate. He likely understands how to play the political game, and is “electable.” He has some high profile “wins,” a prime example being the bipartisan mostly well-liked First Step Act. Unfortunately, he also has his history of being a Senator that means that he might have more “dirty laundry” that can be used against him in his voting history. He would also be going against an incumbent and has yet to really distinguish himself in the public psyche. </p>
